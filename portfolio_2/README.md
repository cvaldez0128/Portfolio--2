For portfolio 2, I combined development assignment 4 with the week 12 TODO app. Upon running the react native app, the login page from development assignment-4 will be presented to the user. The password of "Ch@rge!" was kept the same, only this time when it is entered correctly, the TODO list from week 12 will show with new items for the user to complete.

In addition to the TODO list, a new component is also present that displays a series of hints to a secret code that will grant the user access to the next two components. Once guessed correctly and entered into the input box, a component containing a special video can be watched, and another with a short survey can be found as well. 

I also added the functionality of an exit button that, when pressed, will hide the video and survey components. A logout button to return to the login screen is present as well.

For portfolio 2 I took I combined development assignment 4 with the week 12 TODO app. The password of "Ch@rge!" was kept the same, only this time when it is entered the user is presented with the TODO list from week 12 that has new items for the user to complete.

In addition to the TODO list, a new component is also present that displays a series of hints to a secret code that will grant the user access to the next two components. Once guessed correctly and entered into the input box, a component containing a special video can be watched, and another with a short survey can be found as well. 

I also added the functionality of an exit button
